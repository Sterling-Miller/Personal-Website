# Personal Website

This is a personal portfolio website built using [Astro](https://astro.build/), a modern static site generator. The website showcases my profile, work experience, education, and projects. It is designed to be fast, responsive, and easily deployable to platforms like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Astro for building the website.
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for responsive and modern design.
- **Deployment**: Vercel for hosting and server-side rendering.
- **Other Tools**:
  - [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) with [Astro's plugin](https://github.com/withastro/prettier-plugin-astro) for code formatting.

## Template

This project is based on an Astro template provided by Vercel. The template has been customized to include my personal content and design preferences. Deploy your own Astro project using Vercel:
